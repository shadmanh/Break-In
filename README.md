# Break-In

## By: Shadman Hassan

This game requires the use of JDK 8 (Java 1.8) in order to run properly. It was edited in the IntelliJ IDE and thus has this directory format.

This game is a variation of Breakout, but with the theme of breaking in instead. The player controls a character
trying to break into a random house on the street with nothing more than a racket and tennis ball, destroying everything in
his path by doing so. Everything in the environment is made up of bricks. The aim of the game is to destroy every brick in the level
to move on to the next and try to earn as many points as possible. Each brick is only worth one point, but if the player makes the
ball hit multiple bricks before the ball hits the paddle again, a multiplier will be factored into the current streak and the player
will earn even more points. If the player beats the final level or loses all of their lives, the game ends and their final score is
displayed. The game plays a random soundtrack each time the game is started and there are sound effects that play when the ball makes
impact with anything. If the player is able to hit the ball back or scores points, the character has a chance to make a random
remark/comment. Good luck Breaking In!

Everything is written/created by me except for the tennis sprites and music/sound effects.
